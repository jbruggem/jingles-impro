== Building the jingles-qt project ==

This project needs:
- g++
- libvlc-dev
- libqt4-dev
- a "res" (as in "resources") subdirectory with two audio files named "one.mp3" and "two.mp3"

To generate the directory structure and the makefiles for the build:
	$ qmake

To compile in release mode:
	$ make
To compile in debug mode:
	$ make debug
To compile in both debug and release modes:
	$ make all

To compile several files in parallel, use the "-j" flag:
	$ make -j4 all
To make compilation even (much) faster, install and use ccache:
	$ sudo apt-get install ccache
	$ make -j4 CXX="ccache g++" all

To run the generated executables:
	$ ./release/jingles-qt
	$ ./debug/jingles-qt
