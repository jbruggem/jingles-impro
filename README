== Building the jingles-qt project ==

This project needs:
- g++
- libgstreamer0.10-dev
- libqt4-dev

Temporarly, put the files you want to load in 'filestoload.txt'. Syntax is the following:
file path,shouldLoop,start,end,fadeIn,fadeOut,showFileName,buttonOrList

file path: currently no escaping: files with "," in them will not be properly loaded
shouldLoop: boolean
start: time in ms
end: time in ms or -1 if track should be played to the end
fadeIn/fadeOut: [not implemented] time in ms
showFileName: boolean. Should the UI show the filename or the id3 'title' tag?
buttonOrList: 'b' to show in the buttons, 'p' to show in the list 


To generate the directory structure and the makefiles for the build:
	$ qmake

To compile in release mode:
	$ make
To compile in debug mode:
	$ make debug
To compile in both debug and release modes:
	$ make all

To compile several files in parallel, use the "-j" flag:
	$ make -j4 all
To make compilation even (much) faster, install and use ccache:
	$ sudo apt-get install ccache
	$ make -j4 CXX="ccache g++" all

To run the generated executables:
	$ ./release/jingles-qt
	$ ./debug/jingles-qt
